# CacheMe
A modern, social take on geocaching.

## What is Geocaching?
If you don't know what geocaching is, it is (as described in Wikipedia), "an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a Global Positioning System receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called 'geocaches' or 'caches', at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world". This might've been an activity you participated in during elementary school or in boy scouts/girl scouts.

## The Idea
We've combining this location-based activity with some sort of Twitter-like social media app (but definitely without all the controversy). Basically, a user of the app would be able to post a text caption, photo, video, etc. at the location they are at. The followers of that user can see that they have posted something but they cannot see the post unless they go to the same location. Posts can be private to just the user that created it, private to just friends, or public to everyone who ever goes to the same location. Also, just like any other social media app, posts can have comments, likes, and shares.

## Purpose
The app lets you create virtual 'buried treasure' out of special memories you might want to keep or share. It could also be really fun to make a scavenger hunt out of it with your friends or for your significant other. And, if you ever return to the same location, you could take a trip down memory lane to see what happened.
